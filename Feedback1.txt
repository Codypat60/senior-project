Two conversations with an instructor and private pilot:

They like the color scheme, reminds them of aviation, that was the goal

Asked about borders around the bottom buttons, will add

Said the bolding on the headers may be too much, might try to reduce font size?

Said the strength of the borders on the cells are too strong, may need to change opacity

Also mentioned that link section should have footer border.

Spoke with multiple pilots, stated they would like links on right side

They would like a picture of a plane or something aviation themed near the title

Pilots seemed very satisifed on the rest, dissapointed there was not more to fix or change
